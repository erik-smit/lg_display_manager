# LG Display Manager

This is the script which I use to manage my LG DualUp 28MQ780 monitor, and only the LG DualUp 28MQ780 monitors on Scalar version v3.3.0, with `Main-v322.M24#29 sha-d4015bb` and `Sub-v322.M24#29 sha-a3bad52` in the Service Menu. The script checks this, but please verify yourself before running, **I take no responsibility if the random mempokes kill your screen!** It literally will not work on any other firmware.
